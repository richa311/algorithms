# Algorithms

An algorithm describes a way of solving a specific problem.

Sorting Algorithms
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

Searching Algorithms
Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
